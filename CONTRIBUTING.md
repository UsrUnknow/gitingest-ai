## Bonnes pratiques de commit et versioning

- Utilisez des commits **atomiques**‚ÄØ: chaque commit doit correspondre √† une modification logique unique.
- Adoptez la convention [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) pour illustrer l‚Äôintention de vos commits avec un emoji (copiez l‚Äôemoji directement dans le message).
- Structure recommand√©e‚ÄØ: `<emoji> <type/scope>: message explicite`
  - Exemples‚ÄØ:
    - `‚ú® feat(cli): ajout de la g√©n√©ration dynamique des sous-commandes`
    - `‚ôªÔ∏è refactor: centralisation des r√®gles de classification dans YAML`
    - `üêõ fix: gestion correcte des allowlist dans le scan`
    - `üöÄ perf: parall√©lisation de la lecture des fichiers`
    - `üìù docs: mise √† jour du README et des instructions de contribution`
- Respectez le versioning s√©mantique (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) pour les releases.
